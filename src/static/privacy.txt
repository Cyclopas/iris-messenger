Iris Privacy Policy

By default, the application connects to a number or relays in the Nostr network in order to send and receive messages. The relays are not operated by Iris developers. You can change the default relays at will.

The application also connects to a GunDB relay by default, which is run by Iris developers. GunDB is used to store your public list of blocked users. The relay is also used to measure the number of active users of the application. You can disable or change the default GunDB relay at will.

Otherwise, Iris developers do not collect any information about you or your usage of the application.
