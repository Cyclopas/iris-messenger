Iris Privacy Policy

By default, the application connects to a number or relays in the Nostr network in order to send and receive messages. The relays are not operated by Iris developers. You can change the default relays at will.

On Nostr, private messages are encrypted, but anyone can see who you're chatting with and when.

The application wraps the web application at https://iris.to. The hosting provider logs user IP addresses and page-view counts, which are used to follow unique user count and usage by country.

Otherwise, Iris developers do not collect any information about you or your usage of the application.
